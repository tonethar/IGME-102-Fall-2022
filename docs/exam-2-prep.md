## III. Study Tips

1) Object Literals and Maps
    - BTW - In programming, what is a *Collection*?
      - See **Object Literals** PDF - Slide #20
    - **Object Literals** PDF - Slide #2
      - *What is an object?* 
      - *What do objects consist of?*
      - *What is a class?*
      - *What do objects/classes "do" for the programmer?*
      - How do we "loop" over the keys of an Object Literal?
    - **Key-Value Pairs and Maps** PDF
      - Name 2 differences between object literals and maps
      - See Slide #10, *Useful Map methods*

2) Stacks, Queues, Sets
    - Be able to describe their structure in "plain english" - for example - this is from Slide #8 of the **Stacks** PDF in myCourses:
      - *A **stack** data structure acts like a literal stack of objects*
      - *You can only interact with the data currently on "top" of the stack*
      - *If you want data from the middle, you must first remove everything above it*
      - *The image on this slide (a pile of teacups) is a good metaphor for a stack*
    - Slide #10 talks about **LIFO**  - "Last In, First Out" 
    - Slides #9 and #13 discuss the most common actions that are performed on a Stack, which are **push**, **pop**, **peek**, **contains** and **clear**
    - Be sure that you review the **Queues and Callbacks** PDF and understand how Queues are different from Stacks
    - Be sure that you review the **Collection Sets Iterators** PDF and understand how Sets are different from Arrays, Stacks and Queues.
    
3) Parsing text, JSON, Array destructuring, et al. (Will review on Friday)


## IV. Cheat Sheet
- One 3" x 5" index card, hand-written, is allowed
