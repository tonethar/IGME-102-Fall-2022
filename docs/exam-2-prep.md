## III. Study Tips

1) Stacks, Queues, and Sets
    - Be able to describe their structure in "plain english" - for example - this is from Slide #8 of the  **Stacks** PDF in myCourses:
      - *A **stack** data structure acts like a literal stack of objects*
      - *You can only interact with the data currently on "top" of the stack*
      - *If you want data from the middle, you must first remove everything above it*
      - *The image on this slide (a pile of teacups) is a good metaphor for a stack*
    - Slide #10 talks about **LIFO**  - "Last In, First Out" 
    - Slides #9 and #13 discuss the most common actions that are performed on a Stack, which are **push**, **pop**, **peek**, **contains** and **clear**
