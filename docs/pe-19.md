# PE-19 - Higher Order Functions


## Overview
You will be editing code of your work in progress to use higher-order functions to iterate over and filter arrays of state census data. Start with your PE18 (or HW5 code) to complete this exercise. 

<hr>

## I. Get started

- Duplicate the sketch folder and rename it ***lastName-PE19-small-states***

<hr>

## II. In the `readStates()` function in **sketch.js**

- After using a loop to create an array of State instances in stateArray, we will then use higher-order array method to create a new array that "filters out" some of the State instances.

#1 - Filter high-population states out of JSON data. Today we only want to analyze census data for census states that have fewer people in them. Set `stateArray` equal the value returned from calling the `.filter()` array method of `stateArray` with a function expression. The function expression should return a boolean for whether the current state's population is smaller than 6,000,000 (true or false).

#2 -	After filtering, print the reduced length of the states JSON data to the console - e.g. `"There are  XX states with a population less that 6,000,000"`

#3 -	Make sure the functionality of your program is unhurt by these changes.
updateViz() function in Main Sketch:
6.	Comment out the for loop (don’t delete it yet – you will probably copy/paste parts of it). In its place…
7.	Call display() for every state. Use the .forEach() array method of stateArray with a function expression to call the .display() method for each state in it.
8.	Make sure the functionality of your program is unhurt by these changes.
Submission: 
Make sure you comment and follow the coding standards for all code you create.

# III. Submission
- Zip your entire PE19 sketch folder and submit it to the PE19  dropbox.
