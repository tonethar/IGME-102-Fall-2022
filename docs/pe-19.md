# PE-19 - Higher Order Functions


## Overview
You will be editing code of your work in progress to use higher-order functions to iterate over and filter arrays of state census data. Start with your PE18 (or HW5 code) to complete this exercise. 

## I. Begin by duplicating the sketch folder and renaming it ***PE19-smallStates-Lastname***

## II. In the `readStates()` function in **sketch.js**

- After using a loop to create an array of State instances in stateArray, we will then use higher-order array method to create a new array that "filters out" some of the State instances.

1.	Comment out the for loop (don't delete it yet – you will probably copy/paste parts of it). In its place…
2.	Filter high-population states out of JSON data. Today we only want to analyze census data for census states that have fewer people in them. Set the JSON parameter variable states [or whatever you named it], equal to the value returned from calling the .filter() array method of states with a function expression.
The function expression should return a boolean for whether the current state item’s .sex[0] value is smaller than 6,000,000 (true or false).
3.	After filtering, print the reduced length of the states JSON data to the console (e.g. “ ____ smaller states”).
4.	Add new States to stateArray. Call the .forEach() array method of states with a function expression. Inside the function:
•	For each state item, call the constructor for the State class with the item as its parameter. Add the resulting new State to the global stateArray.
5.	Make sure the functionality of your program is unhurt by these changes.
updateViz() function in Main Sketch:
6.	Comment out the for loop (don’t delete it yet – you will probably copy/paste parts of it). In its place…
7.	Call display() for every state. Use the .forEach() array method of stateArray with a function expression to call the .display() method for each state in it.
8.	Make sure the functionality of your program is unhurt by these changes.
Submission: 
Make sure you comment and follow the coding standards for all code you create.
Zip your entire PE19 sketch folder and submit it to the PE19  dropbox.
