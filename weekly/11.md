## I. Monday

## I-A. Questions on PE-14 & PE-15?

## I-B. Working with JSON files - "JavaScript Object Notation"
- See *External JSON Files* PDF in myCourses (slide #10+)
- JSON files are another way to store application data
  - built from object literals and/or arrays (of object literals)
  - **Object Key/property**: always a `string`, always enclosed in quotes.]
  - **Object Value**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, or `object` literal

## I-C. JSON data Examples
- https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/rooms.json
- https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/bubble-data.json
- https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/102.10-1stateCensusData2019.json
- https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5?get=B02001_001E,B01001_002E,B01001_026E,B05010_002E,B19013_001E,B25077_001E,NAME&for=state:*
- https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/P2stateCensusData.json


- ***BTW - go install the [Chrome JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh?hl=en-US) extension, now. You will be glad that you did***

## I-D. Loading a simple JSON file

```js
function setup() {  
  // load the data with a callback
  loadJSON("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/rooms.json","json",checkData);
}

// this "callback" function gets called after the file has loaded successfully
function checkData(objData) {
  console.log("Num results =",objData.length);
  // loop through and look at each object
  for(let obj of objData){
    console.log(obj.name, obj.color, obj.food, obj.breed);
  }
}
```

## I-E. PE-16 *JSON*

- Will be loading in and parsing this file - https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/102.10-1stateCensusData2019.json
  - Is an "array of 51 arrays" (a "2-dimensional" array) that contains specific 2019 US census data broken down by state
    - the 1st element of each array is the total population of the state
    - the 2nd element is the total number of males in the state
    - the 3rd element is the total number of females in the state
    - the 4th element is the total number of people below the poverty line in the state
    - the 5th element is the average income in the state
    - the 6th element is the average home value in the state
    - the 7th element is the name of the state
 - You will be using a number formatter (see last week's slides and link below):
   - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat
 - You will be using a array destructuring to assign the variables (see last week's slides)
 - BTW - `"\n"` is the "new line" character - in a `console.log()` it gives you a blank line
