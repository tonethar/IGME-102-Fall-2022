### I-B. Review PE-03
- Review PE-03
- Add keyboard control


### I-C. HW-01
- The PDF is in myCourses
- The myCourses dropbox is up - this is due <s>Thursday night at 11:59PM</s>
- There will be a short extension, and
  - we will spend the rest of class working on it
  - get started by making a new p5 project in VSCode ...
  - and then it's OK to copy over some code, maybe some of **Pac.js**
  - anything that looks like "PE-03 with keyboard controls" will receive a grade of zero
  - REMINDER: This needs to be completed individually, and "new work" on your part. Handing in a previously submitted assignment (from 101 or 102) is *duplicate submission* and is considered a violation of RIT's Academic Integrity policy
- Try adding some instructions to the HTML page

```html
<h1>PE 01</h1>
<p>Hit the 's' and 'w' keys and see what happens!</p>
```

### I-D. Code commenting standard
