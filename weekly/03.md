### I-B. Review PE-03
- Review PE-03
- Add keyboard control


### I-C. HW-01
- The PDF is in myCourses
- The myCourses dropbox is up - this is due <s>Thursday night at 11:59PM</s>
- There will be a short extension, and
  - we will spend the rest of class working on it
  - get started by making a new p5 project in VSCode ...
  - and then it's OK to copy over some code, maybe some of **Pac.js**
  - anything that looks like "PE-03 with keyboard controls" will receive a grade of zero
  - REMINDER: This needs to be completed individually, and "new work" on your part. Handing in a previously submitted assignment (from 101 or 102) is *duplicate submission* and is considered a violation of RIT's Academic Integrity policy
- Try adding some instructions to the HTML page

### II-C `for..of` loop presentation
- See myCourses for PDF pf slides
- Demo code:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(220);
  
  let myArray = ["hey", "aloha", "hello", "hola", "sannu"];
  
  // slide 2 - loop through array with while loop
  let i = 0;
  while (i < myArray.length) {
    console.log("word?", myArray[i]);
    i++;
  }
  // It would be worse if I hard-coded
  // 5 instead of using .length

  
  // slide 3 - loop through array with for loop
  for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	console.log("word?", myArray[i]);
  }
  // Fewer things to scan for brokenness.
  // It would be worse if I hard-coded
  // 5 instead of using .length


  // slide 4 - loop through array with for..of loop
  for (let item of myArray) {
	console.log("word?", item);
  }
  // Fewest things to scan for brokenness

  
  // slide 6
  /* 
  If you need to work with the array index 
  as well as the array item, stick with the regular 
  3-part for loop. Otherwise, use for..of 
  */

  let play = [5,7,3,2,4,6,7,1];

  for (let num of play) {
	console.log("Item is", num);
  }
  
  for (let letter of "Great morning") {
	print("Character is", letter);
  }
  
  // slide 7
  /* 
  If you need to work with the array index as well as the     
  array item, stick with the regular 3-part for loop. 
  Otherwise, use for..of 
  */

  for (let i = 0; i < play.length; i++) {
	text(play[i], 5, 15 + i * 10);
  }
  
  let greeting = "Great morning";
  for (let n = 0; n < greeting.length; n++) {
	text(greeting[n], 50, 15 + n * 10);
  }

}
```

### II-D. Arrays

```js
const stuff = []; // initialize an empty array
colors.push("red");
colors.push("green");
for (let c of colors){
  console.log("c=",c); // "red", "green"
}

const geese = [new Goose()]; // initialize and array with a new Goose instance in it
geese.push(new Goose()); // add new Goose instance to array
for (let g of geese){
  g.display();
}
```

### II-E. PE-04 - `for..of` loops
- Uses PE-03 as a starting point
- See dropbox in myCourses - Due Sunday night
