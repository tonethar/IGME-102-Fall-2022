# Week 1 Notes
- YOU DO NOW - set up a Google Doc for this course - add a "week 1" heading - and start taking notes

## I. Monday

### I-A. Handy Links
- http://editor.p5js.org


### I-B. What does a software developer do? (you are all software developers)
- Solve Problems, often with computer code

### I-C. What is computer code?
- a way to tell a computer what to do
- a detailed set of instructions written in a particular programming language

### I-D. Some Building blocks of programming
- **Variables** (some definitions)
    - Best definition: "named *containers* for *values*"
    - a symbolic name for (or reference to) information
    - names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
    - an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity
    - In software programming, variables are names used to hold one or more values. Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in your code, the variable holds the results of a calculation, database call, results of a database query, or other value. Instead of multiple calculations or the load of multiple database calls to retrieve the same data, the variable is stored in computer memory once and used wherever it is needed in your code
- Variables contain (or "point at") **values** - which have a very fuzzy definition ...
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3300726/what-is-a-value-in-the-context-of-programming
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)
- Values are catagorized by **type**
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type
- **Some JavaScript Types** - `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`
  - Head to http://editor.p5js.org, and in the `setup()` function:
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `firstName` that contains the `String` value "Bob"
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `score` that contains the `Number` value 100 
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `isActive` that contains the `Boolean` value false 
  - Confirm the type of each variable with the `typeof()` function
    - `console.log(firstName,typeof(firstName))` // do this for all 3 variables
  - Note that in JavaScript (unlike many programming languages), variables can point at ANY type of value

### I-E. Building blocks of programming - the `function`
- "a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine
- a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task
- functions usually "take in" one or more values, process them, and "return" a result
- you can use the code in a function over and over again by "calling it", rather than writing out that code multiple times

```js
function sayHello(){
  return "Hello";
}

console.log(sayHello());
```

### I-F. Try it

1) Write a function named `doubleIt()`
  
  - the function accepts 1 `Number` parameter, and returns that number doubled
  - test the `doubleIt()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("1 doubled is", doubleIt(1));  // 2
console.log("2 doubled is", doubleIt(2));  // 4
console.log("3 doubled is", doubleIt(3));  // 6
```

2) Write a function named `areaOfRectangle()`

- the function accepts 2 `Number` parameters, a `width` and a `height`, and returns the product of those 2 numbers
- test the `areaOfRectangle()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("1 doubled is", doubleIt(1));  // 2
console.log("2 doubled is", doubleIt(2));  // 4
console.log("3 doubled is", doubleIt(3));  // 6
```

3) Write a function named `greeter2()` 
- the function accepts a `String` parameter that represents a proper name, and will return the String `"Hello "` with the name *concatenated* to it 
- test the `greeter2()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("Greeting to Bob =", greeter2("Bob"));  // Hello Bob!
console.log("Greeting to Betty =", greeter2("Betty"));  // Hello Betty!
console.log("Greeting to Blue Sky =", greeter2("Blue Sky"));  // Hello Blue Sky!
```
 
### I-G. Local and global variable *scope*
- Let's look at today's slides and discuss the *scope* (visibility and lifetime) of variables and functions

### I-H. Here's a "checkoff" (small HW assignment)
- Due prior to our next meeting (see dropbox for exact due date)
- Get the above code running in the HTML page below (make you own copy of it named **lastname-firstinitial-day-1.html** (with your actual last name and first initial)
  - Open the page in Chrome
  - Check the console to verify that your console logs are visible (right-click and choose "Inspect" to see the JS console)
- Now create a function named `letterGrade()` that takes a `Number` between 0 and 100 and returns the approriate letter grade
- The function should use multiple `if()` statements to check the passed in numeric grade:
  - 90-100 (inclusive) is a A
  - 80-89 (inclusive) is a B
  - 70-79 (inclusive) is a C
  - 65-69 (inclusive) is a D
  - Less than 65 is an F
- test the `letterGrade()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("Letter grade for 100 is", letterGrade(100)); // "A"
console.log("Letter grade for 90 is", letterGrade(90)); // "A"
console.log("Letter grade for 80 is", letterGrade(80)); // "B"
console.log("Letter grade for 70 is", letterGrade(70)); // "C"
console.log("Letter grade for 65 is", letterGrade(65)); // "D"
console.log("Letter grade for 64 is", letterGrade(100)); // "F"
