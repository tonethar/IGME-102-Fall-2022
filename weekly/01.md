  - put the link to this page in the document
  - start taking notes
- (Or do whatever works for you, an MS Word docs, a tablet app, etc ...)

## I. Monday

### I-A. Handy Links
- http://editor.p5js.org


### I-B. What does a software developer do? (you are all software developers)
- Solve Problems, often with computer code

### I-C. What is computer code?
- a way to tell a computer what to do
- a detailed set of instructions written in a particular programming language

### I-D. Some Building blocks of programming
- **Variables** (some definitions)
    - Best definition: "named *containers* for *values*"
    - a symbolic name for (or reference to) information
    - names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
    - an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity
    - In software programming, variables are names used to hold one or more values. Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in your code, the variable holds the results of a calculation, database call, results of a database query, or other value. Instead of multiple calculations or the load of multiple database calls to retrieve the same data, the variable is stored in computer memory once and used wherever it is needed in your code
- Variables contain (or "point at") **values** - which have a very fuzzy definition ...
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3300726/what-is-a-value-in-the-context-of-programming
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)
- Values are catagorized by **type**
  - *a set of possible values and a set of allowed operations on it.* - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type
  - For example, in older versions of the C programming language an `Int` is all numeric values between `0` and `32,767`. The operations of an `Int` include the common arithmetic operators as well as bitwise operators
- **Some JavaScript Types** - `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`
  - Head to http://editor.p5js.org, and in the `setup()` function:
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `firstName` that contains the `String` value "Bob"
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `score` that contains the `Number` value 100 
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `isActive` that contains the `Boolean` value false 
  - Confirm the type of each variable with the `typeof()` function
    - `console.log(firstName,typeof(firstName))` // do this for all 3 variables
  - Note that in JavaScript (unlike many programming languages), variables can point at ANY type of value

### I-E. Building blocks of programming - the `function`
- "a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine
- a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task
- functions usually "take in" one or more values, process them, and "return" a result
- you can use the code in a function over and over again by "calling it", rather than writing out that code multiple times

```js
function sayHello(){
  return "Hello";
}

console.log(sayHello());
```

### I-F. Try it

1) Write a function named `doubleIt()`
  
  - the function accepts 1 `Number` parameter, and returns that number doubled
  - test the `doubleIt()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("1 doubled is", doubleIt(1));  // 2
console.log("2 doubled is", doubleIt(2));  // 4
console.log("3 doubled is", doubleIt(3));  // 6
```

2) Write a function named `areaOfRectangle()`

- the function accepts 2 `Number` parameters, a `width` and a `height`, and returns the product of those 2 numbers
- test the `areaOfRectangle()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("a 1x1 rectangle's area is", areaOfRectangle(1,1));  // 1
console.log("a 2x2 rectangle's area is", areaOfRectangle(2,2));  // 4
console.log("a 3x3 rectangle's area is", areaOfRectangle(3,3));  // 9
```

3) Write a function named `sayHello()` 
- the function accepts a `String` parameter that represents a proper name, and will return the String `"Hello "` with the name *concatenated* to it 
- The easiest way to do string concatenation is with the `+` operator (and there are other ways too)
- test the `sayHello()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("Greeting to Bob =", sayHello("Bob"));  // Hello Bob!
console.log("Greeting to Betty =", sayHello("Betty"));  // Hello Betty!
console.log("Greeting to Blue Sky =", sayHello("Blue Sky"));  // Hello Blue Sky!
```
 
### I-G. Local and global variable *scope*
- Let's look at today's slides and discuss the *scope* (visibility and lifetime) of variables and functions

<a id="checkoff" />

### I-H. Here's a "checkoff" (small HW assignment)
- Due soon - see dropbox for exact due date
- Get the above code running in the HTML page below (make you own copy of it named **lastname-firstinitial-day-1.html** (with your actual last name and first initial)
  - Open the page in Chrome
  - Check the console to verify that your console logs are visible (right-click and choose "Inspect" to see the JS console)
- Now create a function named `letterGrade()` that takes a `Number` between 0 and 100 and returns the approriate letter grade
- The function should use multiple `if()` statements to check the passed in numeric grade:
  - Greater than 100 is an A
  - 90-100 (inclusive) is a A
  - 80-89 (inclusive) is a B
  - 70-79 (inclusive) is a C
  - 65-69 (inclusive) is a D
  - Less than 65 is an F
- test the `letterGrade()` function with the following:

```js
console.log("Letter grade for 110 is", letterGrade(110)); // "A"
console.log("Letter grade for 100 is", letterGrade(100)); // "A"
console.log("Letter grade for 90 is", letterGrade(90)); // "A"
console.log("Letter grade for 80 is", letterGrade(80)); // "B"
console.log("Letter grade for 70 is", letterGrade(70)); // "C"
console.log("Letter grade for 65 is", letterGrade(65)); // "D"
console.log("Letter grade for 64 is", letterGrade(64)); // "F"
```

      console.log("3 doubled is", doubleIt(3));  // 6
      
      // Add the doubleIt(), areaOfRectangle() and sayHello() functions above
      // and test those functions with the console.logs here
      // Then create the letterGrade() function above, and test it here

## II. Wednesday

### II-A. Handy Links
- http://editor.p5js.org
- https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- An overview of JavaScript syntax - worth watching - https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-the-javascript-language-2/

### II-B. Review
- `doubleIt()`
- `areaOfRectangle()`
- `sayHello()`
  - [String concatenation](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/string/javascript-string-concatenation/)

### II-C. Functions - a few things to clarify

**1) "Calling" functions**

  - we call a function by putting parentheses - `()` - after the name of the function
    - for example - the built-in `alert` function is called like this `alert()` - which causes a pop up window to appear in the browser window  - try running this in the JavaScript console - BTW: don't ever use this annoying feature in your own code!
  - when we called the `alert()` function above, we didn't "pass" any values to it, which we do by putting them in the parentheses
    - we can easily pass values to functions like this - `alert("Hi there!")` - try running this in the JavaScript console
  - much of the time we will pass *values* to the functions that we call - these values are called *arguments* (or *parameters*) - see the difference between these two terms here - https://www.educative.io/answers/parameter-vs-argument
  - Here's an example of passing an argument to a built-in function:
    - `parseInt("21abc")` - try running this in the JavaScript console
  - More commonly you will want to store the result (the `return` value of the function) in a variable (recall that variables are "named containers for values")
    - `let age = parseInt("21abc")` - try running this in the JavaScript console
    - `age++`
    - `console.log(age)`
    - `typeof(age)`
 
**2) Writing functions**

  - One way to declare (write) our own functions is to use the `function` keyword like this:

```js
function sum(num1,num2){
  const sum = num1 + num2;
}

console.log("sum(1,2)=",sum(1,2);
```

  - In the above example, `num1` and `num2` are *parameters* (a kind of variable) that are used to pass values into the function
  - If you run the code above, you'll see that we forgot to do something in our `sum` function
  - This particular function is pretty useless if we forget to `return` the sum of the numbers
  - Go ahead and fix this problem and run the code again

**3) Function parameter default values**

  - Try running this code - `console.log("sum()=",sum();`
  - What do you get?
  - Now modify the first line of the function to look like this - `function sum(num1=0,num2=0){`

**4) "Nesting" function calls**


**5) "Chaining" function calls**
