# Week 1 Notes
- YOU DO NOW - set up a Google Doc for this course - add a "week 1" heading - and start taking notes

## I. Monday

### I-A. Handy Links
- http://editor.p5js.org


### I-B. What does a software developer do? (you are all software developers)
- Solve Problems, often with computer code

### I-C. What is computer code?
- a way to tell a computer what to do
- a detailed set of instructions written in a particular programming language

### I-D. Some Building blocks of programming
- **Variables** (some definitions)
    - Best definition: "named *containers* for *values*"
    - a symbolic name for (or reference to) information
    - names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
    - an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity
    - In software programming, variables are names used to hold one or more values. Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in your code, the variable holds the results of a calculation, database call, results of a database query, or other value. Instead of multiple calculations or the load of multiple database calls to retrieve the same data, the variable is stored in computer memory once and used wherever it is needed in your code
- Variables contain (or "point at") **values** - which have a very fuzzy definition ...

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(computer_science)
- Values are catagorized by **type**
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type
- **Some JavaScript Types** - `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`
  - Head to http://editor.p5js.org, and in the `setup()` function:
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `firstName` that contains the `String` value "Bob"
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `score` that contains the `Number` value 100 
    - using JavaScript, declare a variable named `isActive` that contains the `Boolean` value false 
  - Confirm the type of each variable with the `typeof()` function
    - `console.log(firstName,typeof(firstName))` // do this for all 3 variables
  - Note that in JavaScript (unlike many programming languages), variables can point at ANY type of value

### I-E. Building blocks of programming - the `function`
- "a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine
- a block of organized code that is used to perform a single task
- functions usually "take in" one or more values, process them, and "return" a result
- you can use the code in a function over and over again by "calling it", rather than writing out that code multiple times
