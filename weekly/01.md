- Solve Problems, often with computer code

### I-C. What is computer code?
- a way to tell a computer what to do
- a detailed set of instructions written in a particular programming language

### I-D. Some Building blocks of programming
- **Variables** (some definitions)
    - named *containers* for *values*
    - a symbolic name for (or reference to) information
    - names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program
    - an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity
    - In software programming, variables are names used to hold one or more values. Instead of repeating these values in multiple places in your code, the variable holds the results of a calculation, database call, results of a database query, or other value. Instead of multiple calculations or the load of multiple database calls to retrieve the same data, the variable is stored in computer memory once and used wherever it is needed in your code
- Variables contain (or "point at") **values**

- Values are catagorized by **type**
