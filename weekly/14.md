## I. Wednesday

### I-A. Exam #2 Review
- It went well!
- Let's review the answers

<hr>

### I-B. Final Exam (Exam #3)
- The final exam is scheduled for Wednesday 12/14 from 10:45PM-1:15PM in ORN-1380
- Will be cumulative and cover topics from the entire semester
- Reminder: you need a 70% average on the exams to pass the course
- The lowest grade of the 3 exams will be ***dropped*** prior to calculating the exam average and final course grade

### I-D. HW-6
- See myCourses for *HW-6 Sprites World* PDF
- See myCourses for *HW6 Process Worksheet* PDF

<hr>

### I-E. Demo/HW-6 Starter
- Create a new p5 project with VSCode
- Grab **images** folder from myCourses and put into project folder
- Stuff we will do together:
  - loading image files
  - drawing Images
  - creating an `ImageSprite` class
    - implement `constructor()`
    - implement `display()`
    - implement `move()`
  - creating instances of `ImageSprite` and putting them in an array
- Stuff you will do (show me it's complete before you leave):
  - Create a new `ImageSprite` (at the location of the mouse) when you click on the sketch
  - "Bouncing" sprites
    - you'll need `this.xSpeed` and `this.ySpeed`
    - and the `width` and `height` of the canvas
    - among other things

## III. Friday/Monday

### III-A. Collisions between sprites
- If your sprites are circular, it's really easy! 
  - #1 - calculate the distance between the center points of two circles
  - #2 - if the distance is less than sum of radius of the 2 circles, the circles are overlapping (i.e. colliding)
  - Demo: https://editor.p5js.org/dfeusse/sketches/H1vD7NQjb
- If your sprites are (roughly) rectangular, you can look to see if their *bounding boxes* intersect
  - see **12-5-starter.zip** in myCourses
  - Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2752349/fast-rectangle-to-rectangle-intersection
  - put this code in **sketch.js**, and we'll write the rest together:

```js
function rectsIntersect(r1, r2) {
  return (r1.left <= r2.right &&
          r2.left <= r1.right &&
          r1.top <= r2.bottom &&
          r2.top <= r1.bottom);
}
```

### III-B. Animating (changing the image) of your sprites
- Here we'll use a Sprite Sheet to create walking animation
- Get a fresh copy of **12-5-starter.zip**
- Download **smb_mario_sheet.png** from myCourses
- Here is our sprite sheet data - add this to the bottom of **sketch.js**:

```js
var marioFrameData = {
  "frames": {
    "left-1": {
      "frame": {
        "x": 83,

### III-C. Other demos that might help
- See the Week 10 [StringSprite](10.md#v-in-class-demo---stringsprite) demo where we wrote code to determine if a sprite was clicked on
  - The completed version of this demo is in Week 14 of myCourses (You are welcome)
