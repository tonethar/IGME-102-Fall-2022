### I-E. Demo/HW-6 Starter
- Create a new p5 project with VSCode
- Grab **images** folder from myCourses and put into project folder
- Stuff we will do together:
  - loading image files
  - drawing Images
  - creating an `ImageSprite` class
    - implement `constructor()`
    - implement `display()`
    - implement `move()`
  - creating instances of `ImageSprite` and putting them in an array
- Stuff you will do (show me it's complete before you leave):
  - Create a new `ImageSprite` (at the location of the mouse) when you click on the sketch
  - "Bouncing" sprites
    - you'll need `this.xSpeed` and `this.ySpeed`
    - and the `width` and `height` of the canvas
    - among other things

## III. Friday/Monday

### III-A. Collisions between sprites
- If your sprites are circular, it's really easy! 
  - #1 - calculate the distance between the center points of two circles
  - #2 - if the distance is less than sum of radius of the 2 circles, the circles are overlapping (i.e. colliding)
  - Demo: https://editor.p5js.org/dfeusse/sketches/H1vD7NQjb

<hr>

### III-B. Animating (changing the image) of your sprites
- Sprite sheet demo

<hr>

### III-C. Other demos that might help
- See the Week 10 [StringSprite](10.md#v-in-class-demo---stringsprite) demo where we wrote code to determine if a sprite was clicked on
  - The completed version of this demo is in Week 14 of myCourses (You are welcome)
