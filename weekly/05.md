## I. Monday

### I-A. PE-06 *Inheritance Arrays*

- Review submissions
- You just used *Polymorphism*!
  - Polymorphism = The ability to appear in many forms
- Inheritance says:
  - *"I get stuff from my parent"*
- Polymorphism says:
  - *"I count as both my class and my parent class"*
  - *"And I can override their methods"*
  - Goldfish says *"I am both a Goldfish and a Pet"*
- Polymorphism with Candy:
  - When you *overrode* the base `Candy` class `display()` (which just drew a circle) so that each *derived class* could do something a little different under the same method name
  - `Regular.display()` - ex. showed the word "Regular"
  - `Sprinked.display()` - ex. drew some very small additional circles on top of the candy
  - `Striped.display()` - ex. drew 3 lines across the middle of the candy
  - `Wrapped.display()` - ex. drew a translucent rectangle over the candy



### I-B. Array operations
- See *Arrays and Collections* PDF in myCourses
- What is an array?
  - an ordered collection of elements
  - we can access these elements by their position aka *index*
  - the first element in an array is at index = `0`

### I-C. PE-07 *Collections Array*

### I-D. HW-2 Questions?
