## I. Monday

### I. Review HW-1
- They came out really well!
- "Gotchas" to watch for (in all out our PE's and HW's):
  -  Aways hand something in before the dropbox closes, even if it doesn't work. Add comments to the dropbox submission to let me know what you tried or what happened.
  - [Code Commenting Examples](../docs/code-commenting-examples.md)
  - Class files - for example `class Creature{...}` are always in a separate file of the same name (ex. **Creature.js**)
  - Keep code like `keyPressed()`, `mouseClicked()` OUT of your class files:
    - instead, put all "event" code in **sketch.js**, and call methods of the car from the "outside". For example:


```js
let car;

function setup(){
  car = new Car();
}

function draw(){
  if(car.state === "moving"){
    car.move();
  }
}

function keyPressed(){
  if(key === "s" || key === "S"){
    if(car.state === "moving"){
      car.stop();
    }else{
      car.go();
    }
  }
}
```

### I-B. Presentation & Demo - Class Inheritance
- See Inheritance PDF in myCourses
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
  - programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
 - Some OOP (Object Oriented Programming) concepts:
   - **Inheritance** - lets programmers create new classes that share some of the properties of existing classes. Using Inheritance lets us build on previous work without reinventing the wheel.
   - **Encapsulation** - keeping properties within a class private, then providing access to those properties via public methods. Encapsulation is a protective barrier that keeps the data and code safe within the class itself. We can then reuse objects without allowing open access to the data system-wide. This means that we can reuses property names in different classes. For example this means that the value of a `.name` property in a Car instance is completely isolated from `.name` properties in other car instances, and also in (for example) `Dog` instances
   - **Polymorphism** - Allows programmers to use the same word to mean different things in different contexts
     - One form of polymorphism is **method overriding**, which is "when a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes."
       - for example, the `move()` method in a `Puppy` class *overrides* (i.e. "replaces") the `move()` method in the parent `Pet` class
