### III-A. Take the Midterm exam
  - [Midterm Exam Review](../docs/midterm-exam-review.md)


### III-B. PE-12 *Sets*
- See *Collection Sets Iterators* PDF in myCourses
- A `Set` is a collection where each element has to be *unique*
  - There is already a `Set` object in JavaScript (we don't have to build our own)
  - Example: a list of browser bookmarks - when you "favorite" something you don't want it to be duplicated
- Due date on PE-12 has been pushed back (again) to Sunday night (but go ahead and get it done earlier if you have time)
