## Overview
- This week we will finish up review of data structures by covering Stacks, Queues, and Sets
- This will finish up the first part of the course for us:
  - JS review - data types, variable scope
  - functions
  - JS classes and inheritance
  - JS Data Structures (Arrays, Object Literals [aka a “Hash Table”] and Maps, Stacks, Queues, and Sets)

## I. Monday

### I-A. Review HW-03

- Create a `Character` class
  - the Character's `.inventory` property was a JS `Map`
  - the "legal" keys for the inventory, meaning the kind of stuff the character was allowed to carry, were `"Weapon"`, `"Potion"`, `"Gold"` and `"Armor"`
  - other than `display()`, the various methods of the `Character` class were related to management of the `inventory` Map
    - `contains(key)` - is the key already present? Return `true` or `false`
    - `addItem(key, value)` - add an item if it isn't already in the inventory
    - `removeItem(key)` - remove an item if it's present
    - `getValue(key)` - return item's value as a `Number` or `undefined`
    - `changeValue(key, newValue)` - change value of `key`
  - Did you call the `contains(key)` method in the other methods when needed, or instead use `Map.has()` repeatedly?
  - How did you determine what a legal inventory item was?

### I-B. Data structure - `Stack
- See `Stacks` PDF in myCourses

### I-C. PE-10 - Stacks
- Let's start it together!

## II. Wednesday

### II-A. In-class exercise
- Midterm Practice 7A - *Create a class*
- For the 7B HW assignment - **think** about how to do this - we'll talk about it on Wednesday 10/12:

1) create a `this.toys` property of `Dog`

2) `this.toys` is a `Map()`

3) each item in `this.toys` has a key, which is their `name`, and a value which is a rank number 
between 1 and 10

4) `this.toys` is initialized by the constructor by a `toys` parameter

5) `Dog` has a method called `addToy(toy)` that adds a toy to the map

6) `Dog` has a method called `randomToy()` that returns a random toy from the dog's
toy collection

### II-B. Review PE-10 Stacks

- Discuss `Stack`:
  - `constructor()`
  - `pop()` - don't forget to update `this.size`
  - `push(newData)` - don't forget to update `this.size`
  - `peek()`
  - `contains(data)` - several ways to do this
  - `clear()` - several ways to do this, don't forget to update `this.size`
  - `toString()` - several ways to do this
