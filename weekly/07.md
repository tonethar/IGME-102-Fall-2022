## I. Monday

### I-A. Review HW-03

- Create a `Character` class
  - the Character's `.inventory` property was a JS `Map`
  - the "legal" keys for the inventory, meaning the kind of stuff the character was allowed to carry, were `"Weapon"`, `"Potion"`, `"Gold"` and `"Armor"`
  - other than `display()`, the various methods of the `Character` class were related to management of the `inventory` Map
    - `contains(key)` - is the key already present? Return `true` or `false`
    - `addItem(key, value)` - add an item if it isn't already in the inventory
    - `removeItem(key)` - remove an item if it's present
    - `getValue(key)` - return item's value as a `Number` or `undefined`
    - `changeValue(key, newValue)` - change value of `key`

### I-B. Data structure - `Stack
- See `Stacks` PDF in myCourses
