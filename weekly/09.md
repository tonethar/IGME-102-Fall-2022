## II. Wednesday
- Let's get started on File I/O ("Input/Output")
- And *parsing* strings

### II-A. Loading Text
- See *External Text Files Strings* PDF in myCourses
- Loading a text file:
  - https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadStrings
  - `loadStrings()` opens the file whose path is passed in as a parameter, reads the file line by line, and returns an array of strings. 
  - It is asynchronous, so use preload(), or specify a callback function, and optionally an error function
  - `loadStrings(path,[successCallback],[failureCallback])` - returns an array of strings
  - PS - we can load a *local* file (meaning, it's on the same storage device our sketch.js is), or a *remote* file that's out there on the Internet somewhere


```js
loadStrings("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/gettysburg.txt", dataLoaded, loadError);

function dataLoaded(wordArray){
  console.log(wordArray);
}

function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```

### II-B. Strings
- Strings are a series of single characters - technically, an array of characters
- Strings are also objects:
  - they hold data
  - they have methods to do "stuff"
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

```js
const quote = "No good deed goes unpunished";
for(let char of quote){
  console.log(char);
}
```

<hr>

### II-C. Strings are arrays of characters

- We can "loop" through them
