### I-A. Review Exam

### I-B. Review PE-12 *Sets*

<hr>

<a id="wednesday" />

## II. Wednesday
- Let's get started on File I/O ("Input/Output")
- And *parsing* strings - which is *analyze (break) a string or text into logical syntactic components*

### II-A. Loading Text
- See *External Text Files Strings* PDF in myCourses
- Loading a text file:
  - https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadStrings
  - `loadStrings(path)` opens the file whose `path` is passed in as a parameter, reads the file line by line, and returns an array of strings. 
  - It is *asynchronous*:
    - meaning it takes an indeterminate amount of time to happen
    - meaning it occurs in "the background" while our other code executes
    - so use `preload()`, or specify a *callback* function, and optionally an *error* function
  - `loadStrings(path,[successCallback],[failureCallback])` - returns an array of strings
  - PS - we can load a *local* file (meaning, it's on the same storage device our sketch.js is), or a *remote* file that's out there on the Internet somewhere

```js
function setup() {
  // This text file is out on the Internet
  // You can see its contents by pasting the URL into a web brower
  loadStrings("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/gettysburg.txt", dataLoaded, loadError);
}

// called "on success"
function dataLoaded(wordArray){
  console.log(wordArray);
}

// called "on failure"
function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```

<hr>

### II-B. Looking ahead - loading a JSON web service and displaying the results

- Here we a loading a text file - in a format called JSON - that contains real-time information about the most powerful earthquakes that have happened in the world in the last 24-hours
- This is just an example for now - so you can see where we are going in the near future

```js
function setup() {
  loadJSON("https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson", dataLoaded, loadError);
}

// called "on success"
function dataLoaded(json){
  console.log(json);
  let resultsArray = json.features;
  // sort the results "in place" - trying to get today's most powerful earthquake
  resultsArray.sort((a,b) => b.properties.mag - a.properties.mag)
  let highestMag = resultsArray[0];
  let place = highestMag.properties.place;
  let mag = highestMag.properties.mag;
  let timestamp = highestMag.properties.time;
  let date = new Date().toLocaleString();
  console.log("Location:", place, "- Magnitude:", mag, "- Date:", date);
}

// called "on failure"
function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```



<hr>

### II-C. Strings
- Strings are a series of single characters - technically, an array of characters
- Strings are also objects:
  - they hold data
  - they have methods to do "stuff"
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

```js
// String methods
let quote = "No good deed goes unpunished";
quote = quote.toUpperCase();
console.log(quote);
console.log(quote.charAt(0));
console.log(quote.substring(0,2));
console.log(quote.substring(0,7));
console.log(quote.indexOf("DEED"));
console.log(quote.endsWith("UNPUNISHED"));
quote = quote.replace("UNPUNISHED", "PUNISHED")
console.log(quote);
```

<hr>

### II-D. Strings are arrays of characters

- We can "loop" through strings of characters

**Loop & log letters to console, one letter at a time**
```js
const quote = "No good deed goes unpunished";
for(let char of quote){
  console.log(char);
}
```

**Loop & do some p5 drawing**
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(0);
  const quote = "No good deed goes unpunished";
  for(let char of quote){
    fill(55+random(200), 55+random(200), 55+random(200));
    text(char, random(width), random(height))
  }
}
```

<hr>

### II-E. "Split" a string and turn it into an array

**Split a string into 5 "words"**
```js
const quote = "No good deed goes unpunished";
const wordArray = quote.split(" ");
console.log(wordArray);
```

**Split a string into words and visualize it**
```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  background(0);
  const quote = "In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable. - Dwight D. Eisenhower";
  // turn quote into an array
  const wordArray = quote.split(" ");
  let y = 20;
  let x = 5
  for(let word of wordArray){
    //text(word, random(0, width - 20), random(20, height));
    fill(55 + random(200),55 + random(200),55 + random(200))
    text(word, x, y );
    x += 10;
    y += 15;
    
  }
}
```

**Grab a file from the Internet and "split" the words**
```js
function setup() {
  loadStrings("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/gettysburg.txt", dataLoaded, loadError);
}

// called "on success"
function dataLoaded(wordArray){
  console.log(wordArray);
  let string = wordArray[0];
  let gaArray = string.split(" ");
  console.log(gaArray);
}

// called "on failure"
function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```
<hr>

### II-F. Parsing a CSV file

- CSV stands for "comma separated values" - which are commonly imported/exported from spreadsheets
- With CSV, each row is a *record* containing data values about some "thing"
- In an individual row, each attribute of that thing is separated by commas
- See the **cars.csv** file below as an example:
  - each row is a record about a car
  - the attributes of each car (make, model, coolness) are separated by commas
- Unlike data formats such as XML or JSON, CSV values are not *labeled*. Instead, their meaning is based on their *position* in the file
- Believe it or not, CSV is the most popular format for exchanging scientific data sets for research, data science, machine learning, etc

```js
function setup() {
  // This text file is out on the Internet
  // You can see its contents by pasting the URL into a web brower
  loadStrings("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/cars.csv", dataLoaded, loadError);
}

// called "on success"
function dataLoaded(wordArray){
  console.log(wordArray); // each line is in an array
  for (let line of wordArray){
    let car = line.split(",");
    let make = car[0];
    let model = car[1];
    let coolness = car[2];
    console.log(make, model, "- coolness:", coolness);
  }
  // we are actually getting a 6th "car" because of the empty string at the end of the array
  // how to fix this?
}

// called "on failure"
function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```

<hr>

### II-G. Now you try it

1) Use VSCode

2) Load an external text file (that's local) with lyrics to a favorite song or poetry (at least 7 lines) via `loadStrings()` with a callback method

3) Use `.split()` and at least 1 other string/array method on the loaded text

4) Draw the words to the screen using `text()`:

    - For useful p5 text functions,  see today's slides and the *Typography* section of https://p5js.org/reference/

5) Customize the font:

    - https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Typography
    - Use a web safe font https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Web_safe_fonts

6) ZIP and POST to 9B dropbox - we'll look at these next time in class

## III. Friday

### III-A. In-class 9B
- Concepts Covered:
  - Loading text files
    - callback functions
  - Working with strings
    - Looping though strings (which are really arrays of characters)
    - spliting strings into arrays - for example a line of text from a poem - with `string.split(" ")`
  - [String methods](#ii-c-strings)
  - [p5 - Typography functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Typography)
- Let's look at a couple of submissions
- Here's an example:

```js
"use strict";
function setup() {
  // This text file is out on the Internet
  // You can see its contents by pasting the URL into a web brower
  loadStrings("https://people.rit.edu/acjvks/shared/330/data/howl.txt", dataLoaded, loadError);
}

// called "on success"
function dataLoaded(wordArray){
  console.log(wordArray);
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  background(0);
  fill(255);
  textFont("Monospace");
  let x = 20;
  let y = 20;
  let lineNum = 1
  let wordNum = 1
  // loop through lines
  for (let line of wordArray){ 
    // turn each line into an array of words
    let words = line.split(" ");
     // loop through words of each line
    for (let word of words){
      // make first word of each line all caps
      if(wordNum == 1) word = word.toUpperCase();
      // each word gets "redder" and "less green"
      // each line gets "less blue"
      fill(wordNum * 10,255 - wordNum * 10 ,255 - lineNum * 30);
      text(word,x,y);
      // each word moves 5px right, and 20px down
      x += 5;
      y += 20;
      wordNum ++;
    } // end word loop
    // the font sixe for each line goes up by 2
    textSize(textSize() + 2);
    // each line moves 20px right
    x += 20;
    // move each line back up to the top
    y = 20;
    wordNum = 1;
    lineNum ++;
  } // end line loop
}

// called "on failure"
function loadError(error){
  console.log("ERROR",error);
}
```


### III-B. PE-13 *Text Files*

- See PDF in myCourses
- Due Sunday night
- New stuff:
  - Counting unique words with a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
  - Sorting (optional)
- Demo:
  - Counting unique words with an object literal

```js
"use strict";

let string = "Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,we cannot hallow, this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.";

// get rid of string characters we are not interesred in

// turn the string into an array of words

// loop through array and count up unique words
